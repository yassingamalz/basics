## Data Structures

### Generic Stack Implementation

In this project, I've implemented a versatile and efficient generic stack data structure. A stack follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, where elements are added and removed from the same end, known as the "top" of the stack.

#### Features

- **Generics Support**: The stack is designed to be generic, allowing it to store elements of any data type.
- **Dynamic Sizing**: The underlying array dynamically adjusts its size to accommodate the number of elements, ensuring optimal memory usage.
- **Push and Pop Operations**: The stack supports standard operations like push (to add an element) and pop (to remove and retrieve the top element).
- **Exception Handling**: An `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown if a pop operation is attempted on an empty stack, providing robust error handling.

#### Implementation Details
- **File**: [BasicStack.java](src/main/java/basics/structures/stack/BasicStack.java)
